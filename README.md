#  Crop Disease Detection using Machine Learning

# Overview
Crop Disease Detection is a machine learning project developed using **Google Colab** to identify diseases in crops by analyzing leaf images. Early detection of crop diseases plays a crucial role in improving agricultural productivity and minimizing economic losses for farmers.

This project uses image processing and deep learning techniques to classify healthy and diseased crop leaves.

# Objectives
- Detect crop diseases from leaf images
- Automate disease identification using machine learning
- Reduce dependency on manual inspection
- Support early diagnosis for better crop management

# Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

# Project Workflow
1. Dataset collection of crop leaf images  
2. Image preprocessing and augmentation  
3. Model training using deep learning  
4. Disease classification  
5. Result visualization and accuracy evaluation  

# How to Run the Project
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**
2. Upload or connect the dataset
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. Test the model with sample leaf images

# Output
- Classifies crop leaves as **healthy** or **diseased**
- Displays prediction results with confidence
- Visualizes accuracy and loss graphs

# Future Enhancements
- Support for more crop varieties
- Mobile or web-based deployment
- Real-time disease detection using camera input
- Integration with agricultural advisory systems
